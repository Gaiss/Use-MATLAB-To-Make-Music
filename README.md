# Use-MATLAB-To-Make-Music
Use MATLAB to write a melody and play!

With detailed Chinese annotations.

The song I wrote is the school song of Sun Yat-Sen University and I save it as `中山大学校歌.wav`. You can also get a same file by running the [code](https://github.com/Gaiss/Use-MATLAB-To-Make-Music/blob/master/code.m). If you have interest, you can use the code to perform a more complicated piece of music.
